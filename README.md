# Todo Responsive

This project is just for me to test flutter for web and learn how to make a responsive UI.

### Disclaimer

It does not work with Safari for some unknown reason.

## Resources

The design was inspired from this [source](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/to-do-task-list-dark-app-version), I took it and made a web version of it and changed/added some stuff. Also I made a white version of it.

You can see and duplicate the figma [here](https://www.figma.com/file/0iRfDa9r9CyVAOepAqIhRq/Todo?node-id=0%3A1).

## Future work

1- Adding an alarm sound after the pomodoro finished.

2- Link with google calendar.

3- Notification when task is due.

4- Filter tasks on category and filter finished tasks.

5- Fix Safari browser problem
